the folder structure for an airline reservation or flight booking system application can be organized as follows:

Main Folder Structure:
     app/
         routes/
             Contains API-related files and endpoints.
         models/
             Includes database models for Users, Admins, Flights, and Bookings.
         schemas/
             Contains Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
         database/
             Includes database configuration and setup files.
         main.py
             Main FastAPI application file.
     scripts/
         Additional scripts or utilities for the application.
     tests/
         Test files to ensure the functionality of the application.
     requirements.txt
         File listing all required dependencies for the project.
     README.md
         Description of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
Database Setup:
     The database folder should contain scripts to create tables and establish connections with the database.
API Endpoints:
     The API folder should contain files defining different endpoints for user actions like user creation, flight booking, etc.
Models and Schemas:
     The models folder should include Python classes representing database tables (Users, Admins, Flights, Bookings).
     The schemas folder should contain Pydantic models for data validation and serialization in API requests and responses.
Main Application File:
        The main.py file is where the FastAPI application is initialized with routes defined for various functionalities like user creation, flight booking, etc.
Scripts and Tests:
     Additional scripts can be stored in a separate folder for any custom functionalities or utilities needed for the application.
     Test files should be organized in a dedicated folder to ensure proper testing of the application's functionality.
Requirements and Documentation:
     The requirements.txt file lists all dependencies required by the project.
     A README.md file should provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information.

This structured approach helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns within the project, making it easier to manage and scale as needed.
