To design a database schema for the flight booking system based on the provided use cases for both Users and Admin, we need to consider the entities involved and their relationships. Here is a proposed schema:
Entities:

    User
        UserID (Primary Key)
        Username
        Password
        Email
        Phone Number
    Admin
        AdminID (Primary Key)
        Username
        Password
        Email
        Phone Number

    # Can be modified only by admin: POST PUT DELETE
    # user can view one or all  flights: /Flights, /Flights/:{FlightNumber}
    Flight
        FlightNumber (Primary Key)
        DepartureCity
        ArrivalCity
        DepartureDateTime
        ArrivalDateTime
        SeatCount(default=60)

    # user: GET booking/:{BookingID}
    Booking
        BookingID (Primary Key)
        UserID (Foreign Key referencing User.UserID)
        FlightNumber (Foreign Key referencing Flight.FlightNumber)
        BookingDateTime

Relationships:

    Each User can have multiple bookings, so there is a one-to-many relationship between User and Booking.
    Each Flight can have multiple bookings, so there is a one-to-many relationship between Flight and Booking.
    Admins have separate login credentials and can manage flights, so they are distinct from regular Users.

User Use Cases:

    Login
        Validate user credentials against the User table.
    Sign up
        Insert new user details into the User table.
    Searching for flights based on date and time
        Query the Flight table based on the provided date and time criteria.
    Booking tickets on a flight based on availability
        Check seat availability in the Flight table before creating a new booking entry.
    My Booking
        Retrieve bookings associated with the user from the Booking table based on UserID.
    Logout
        End the user's session.

Admin Use Cases:

    Login (Separate login for Admin)
    # /AdminLogin
        Validate admin credentials against the Admin table.
    # POST /Flights/:{FlightNumber}
    Add Flights
        Insert new flight details into the Flight table.
    Remove flights
        Delete flight records from the Flight table.
    View all the booking based on flight number and time
        Query the Booking table based on FlightNumber to view all bookings for a specific flight.

This schema provides a foundation for storing user information, flight details, and booking records while supporting the functionalities outlined in the use cases for both Users and Admins.
